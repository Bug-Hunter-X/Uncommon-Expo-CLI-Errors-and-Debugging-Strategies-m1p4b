The solutions involve carefully examining the project configuration files (`package.json`, `app.json`, `expo.json`), dependency tree, and Expo CLI logs for clues.  Common fixes include:

1. **Version Conflicts:** Double-check package versions in `package.json` for inconsistencies or conflicts using `npm ls` or `yarn why`. Use version ranges strategically to avoid conflicts. Update all packages with `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`. 
2. **Dependency Conflicts:** Use a package lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependencies across different environments. Carefully review dependencies and try removing unnecessary or conflicting ones. 
3. **Configuration Errors:** Review your `app.json` and `expo.json` files for typos, incorrect settings, or mismatched configurations.  Pay close attention to plugin settings, build configurations, and asset specifications.
4. **Environment Variables:** If the error is environment-specific, inspect and review any environment variables that might affect your Expo project.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:**  In some cases, a simple `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start` or a clean rebuild of the project resolves seemingly random errors.  
6. **Expo CLI Version:** Ensure your Expo CLI is up-to-date by running `expo update`.
7. **Check Logs:** The Expo CLI logs often provide important insights into the underlying issue. Examine these for clues about the specific failure.
